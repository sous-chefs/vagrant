- Add. Allow the install of the appimage version of Vagrant.
- Remove. Rubocop.yml doesn'tt need to protect the dangerfile any more.

## 1.0.0

- Convert the resources to custom resources
- Add an env property to the plugin resource to allow for setting environment variables.
- Add an example of installing the vagrant-libvirt plugin, this plugin requires specific environment variable settings. See [vagrant-libvirt/issues/891](https://github.com/vagrant-libvirt/vagrant-libvirt/issues/891)
- Add mac test instructions.
- Update the testing documentation

## 0.9.1

- Update the README to describe the new vagrant resource

## 0.9.0

- Create a custom resource to install vagrant.  Fix issue #69

## 0.8.1

- Change the source respository name
- Add the authorize_service resource for setting up windows testing
- Use environment variable VAGRANT_HOME as the location to install plugins

## 0.8.0

- Add tests for chef-client 14
- Drop testing for chef-client 12
- Fix the calculation of the plugin directory location
- Fixes for Windows 2012R2:
  - The Vagrant installer needs to reboot windows, but the MSI does this in a way that chef can't handle. As an alternative, we make chef interrupt itself and reboot the instance.
  - Related to the above, the MSI returns two specific exit codes when it finishes (but not 0...) that chef needs to know about.
  - Testing windows requires user 'vagrant' to hold the 'Replace a process level token' and 'Adjust Memory Quotas for a process' permissions. At the moment those setting must be made using the secpol.msc interface. A furtur task is to configure the vagrant user via the test cookbook.
  - Vagrant version 1.9.7 suffers from the issue described in #82 (Expected process to exit with [0], but received '-1073741515'). For unknown reasons, this problem is resolved by using 2.0.3 (Perhaps also earlier versions, but they were not tested.)

## 0.7.2

- The package extension for the vagrant mac package changed.
  After version 1.9.2 the extension is _x86_64.dmg.
- The package extension for the vagrant windows package changed.
